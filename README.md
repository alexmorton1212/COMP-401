## COMP 401: Foundations of Programming

This repository includes my coursework from COMP 401 at UNC-Chapel Hill taught by Ketan Mayer-Patel (aka KMP). Assignments were designed by KMP and other contributors (Austin Hale, Jonah Soberano, Sarah Bost).

Class topics included: object-oriented design, classes, interfaces, packages, inheritance, delegation, observers, MVC (model view controller), exceptions, assertions.

<b>This is just to keep my work organized. Follow the UNC-CH honor code if you choose to look at this for your own coursework.</b>
